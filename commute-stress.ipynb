    "## Why simulate data?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is data simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data simulation typically involves generating pseudo random numbers. It is often used in stochastic modeling where some event changes over time. Simulating data has many real world applications. It is used in life sciences, quality control, measuring response rates of customer services, financial and investment modeling and many other areas.  There are several compelling reasons for simulating data [Ref](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/data-simulation). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Known paramaters\n",
    "In a simulated model, the values of the underlying parameters are known. This allows a comparison to be made with the real world dataset it purports to model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tweak parameters\n",
    "Simulating data allows for the parameters to be fine tuned. Parameters may influence each other and performing small adjustments to one parameter can help identify its affect on other inputs such as in sensitivity analysis. In real world situations it may be impossible to control the environment to such an extent that such fine tuned adjustments can be made. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample errors\n",
    "There is a natural variation in data measurements. Collecting one set of flower samples to measure their petal widths is unlikely to yield the exact same measurements if collected at another date. Similarly, asking one set of questions on a survey may produce different responses when asked at another time. There is a natural variation in measurements. The variation in sampling data is a measure of statistical precision. Running data simulations is a valuable way of seeing the effect of randomness on natural processes.    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check things are working correctly\n",
    "Data simulations are useful to check that real world systems are on target or working as expected. A model can be run several times with different parameters or sample sizes and the means or other estimator can be calculated and compared to the real world system. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check statistical power\n",
    "Is there an actual relationship between input values and outputs values? Statistical power is a measure of finding an effect on the data when it exists. It is linked to the sample size used to model the phenomenon in question. Data simulation allows variation in sample size so that statistical power can be analysed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check parameter identification\n",
    "Are the right parameters used? Would a different parameter fit the model better? Data simulation allows for various 'runs' to be conducted with varying parameters. Results can then be checked for clusters and signs that the parameter is indeed a parameter (or not). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check estimator strength\n",
    "Data simulations produce estimators which can then be checked for robustness. If the model does not predict an effect measured by the estimator but the real world data shows such an effect then there is an assumption violation. Simulations help identify this by limiting certain parameters to test out specific ones. This allows the strength of the estimator or the strength of underlying biases to be measured. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Develops understanding of real world phenomena\n",
    "If an analyst can model the real world phenomena in question then they have abstracted its core features, modeled it and recreated the item investigated. This aids their understanding of this phenomenon. \n",
    "references for this came from (Kéry & Royle, 2016)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic modeling\n",
    "Stochastic modeling is a type of mathematical modeling that uses random processes and probability distributions to model some data that can change with time. It is often applied to financial modeling in investments or population modeling in life sciences(Wikipedia contributors, 2018 September 17). \n"

    "The topic chosen for this project is commuting factors and its impact on stress levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this topic?\n",
    "This topic was chosen as I previously commuted several hours per day for both college and work, and currently have family members that make long commutes daily. I hypothesize that there is a relationship between the length of commute, level of control of the journey, the level of impedance experienced commuting and the length of time spent as a commuter with the level of stress experienced. I expect that longer journeys are more stressful than shorter ones; High impedance (e.g. slow traffic) produces more stress and that a low level of perceived control is linked to more stress. I suspect that the longer people spend commuting, the more stress the report but it also may be that the longer people spend commuting the less stress they report as they become use to their daily routine. I came across Cassidy's 1992 paper *Commuting-related Stress: Consequences and Implications* and thought it suitable to model for this assignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Commuting and Stress\n",
    "Modern life is stressful. In pre written history times people experienced stress; Finding food safety and shelter without getting killed takes a toll. Stress can be very useful especially if escaping from a predator. The fight or flight physiological stress response can mean surviving for another day [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response). The same response is found with modern incarnations of stress but the triggers are for the most part very different. Now, we are unlikely to face attacks from a saber tooth tiger. Instead, modern stress triggers are more insidious and chronic. It can be a constant anxiety that permeates everyday life with no clear source or solution. Hassard *et al* (2014) noted that the cost of work related stress in the EU was estimated at 20 billion in 2002. Cassidy, (1992) noted that the UK's gross national product looses up to ten percent per annum due to stress and its consequences. There are many factors contributing to stress, financial stress, relationship stress, health stress to name but a few. This report looks at one source of reported stress, the daily commute. The Central Statistics Office (2017) puts the number of people (workers and students) commuting in Ireland at almost 3 million. They found a steady rise in the number of people commuting to work. What effect does this daily routine have on the psychological and physical health of the population? Costa *et al* as cited in Cassidy (1992) noted that within the European Union, commuters and distance traveled have increased but the duration of the commute has decreased. We are traveling further for work and getting there faster. This has knock on implications with the number of road accidents as well as impact on the home and work life of the people involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cassidy 1992 noted that while commuting itself is stressful it also compounds stress in other domains. It can affect home life, recreational activities and increase work absenteeism. Costa *et al* as cited in Cassidy (1992) found public transport commuters reported a more stressed lifestyle. Whereas Gulian *et al* as cited in Cassidy (1992) found 'road rage' stress was experienced by people who drive to work. Both modes of transportation produce stress. Schaeffer *et al* as cited in Cassidy found that stress levels were mitigated by the **level of control** (or at least perceived control) the commuter had on their journey. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cassidy, (1992) investigated stress and commuting. He conducted a study of 370 participants who commute to work. He collected information via a questionnaire on measures such as daily commute **distance** and **duration**, **time** spent commuting and any **impedance**. Impedance was defined as the average miles per hour the commute took. The lower the speed, the higher the impedance. In addition he also collected information on transportation used, biographical information such as age, sex, marital status, eduction, occupation, length of time in current job, information on home, commuting, work, leisure and personal satisfaction. For the purpose of this report some of Cassidy's measures will be modeled by simulated data and some fields will be simplified. Aspects of Cassidy's paper are modeled in the sections below.\n"

    "    * Commuting domain - perceived commuting stress and mood.  \n",
    "    * Work domain - perceived stress, sources of work stress and commitment to work\n",
    "    * Leisure domain - approach to leisure time including time spent exercising, socialising and perceived fitness.\n",
    "    * Personal domain - problem solving ability and internal/external attribution of events, levels of situational control, motivation and confidence. In addition, levels of satisfaction with life and general perceived stress  were measured. \n",

    "The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was developed by Cohen, Kamarck and Mermelstein in their 1983 paper *A Global Measure of Perceived Stress* published in The Journal of Health and Social Behavior. This is a standard psychological measure of perceived non specific stress. It is used to assess stress and measure the effectiveness of stress reducing interventions (Wikipedia contributors, 2018, May 31). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### PSS questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The PSS elicits responses on a five point Likert scale. A Likert scale involves asking respondents to indicate the level to which they agree or disagree with a series of statements on a scale from 0 to x, where x is the number of points on the Likert scale (Wikipedia contributors, 2018, November 26). For the PSS a response of 0 indicates 'never', 1 indicates 'almost never', 2 indicates 'sometimes', 3 indicates 'fairly often' and 4 indicates 'very often. The PSS contains 10 questions and are listed below. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### Scoring the PSS\n",
    "The Likert scale used in the PSS is balanced to avoid bias in answering all the questions at one extreme of the scale. \n",
    "To determine the score reverse the scores on questions 4, 5, 7 and 8. Then sum the reversed score along with the remainder of the scores to produce a total. Individual scores can range from a minimum of zero to a maximum of 40. The higher the score the greater the perceived stress. Scores under 13 indicate low perceived stress, scores between 14 to 26 indicate moderate perceived stress and scores greater than 27 are considered high perceived stress (Cohen, Kamarck & Mermelstein, 1983). \n",

    "**Transport** refers to the mode of transportation which in Cassidy's (1992) study, can be either public transport or car. It might be useful to further subdivide public transport into bus and train and personal transport into car and bicycle. Research suggests that mode of transportation has an effect on stress with the most stress experienced by car users and least by cyclists (Gatersleben & Uzzell, 2007). Though there is some evidence that commuting by car has greater locus of control which reduces stress (add reference). Stutzer & Frey (2008) noted the *The Commuting Paradox* where the financial benefits of commuting are negated by the negative factors involved such as stress and the impact on home and work life. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Gender** refers to the biological sex of the participant. For Cassidy's study there were 217 male and 153 female participants. Research suggests that there is relationship between stress and gender that would be interesting to explore. Different genders report different physiological stress reactions (American Psychological Association, 2010). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age** Cassidy's study (1992) also measured the ages of the participants. Age does impact physical and mental responses to stress (Monteiro et al, 2014), however it was not modeled in this report for simplicity.  \n"

    "NumPy Random's choice was used to simulate the distances. Choice was used as it allows for the weighted random selection of categorical data. The distance category has four bands (0-5 miles, 6-15 miles, 16-30 miles and Over 30 miles). In addition the data is ordinal, as there is a progression from 0-5 miles to over 30 miles (UCLA: Statistical Consulting Group. (n.d.)). However as these choices were items on a survey, the NumPy Random 'choice' function would be suitable as a model rather than a numerical NumPy Random function such as Bernoulli (Binomial with n = 1) distribution (NumPy community, 2018; Oliphant, 2006). \n",
    "\n",
    "There was a total of 346 responses to this section of the survey so this was taken as the total when calculating the probability weightings for each of the distance bands. A 'Distance' array was created containing the four distance bands, 0-5 miles, 6-15 miles, 16-30 miles, over 30 miles. There were 109 response in the first band so this was weighted as 109/346, 114 for the second band giving a probability of 114/346, 67 responses for the 16-30 mile response giving a weighting of 67/346 and lastly 56 responses for the over 30 mile distance giving a weighting of 56/346.  The model of the Distance variable can be found below.\n"

    "### Duration\n",
    "Add the duration data. In Cassidy's study the duration of commute was 137 participants had 0-30 minutes duration; 121 participants had a commute duration of 30-60 minutes and 97 participants commuting time was over 60 minutes (Cassidy, 1992). This was simulated with np.random.choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why?\n",
    "NumPy Random's choice was used to simulate the duration of commute. There are three bands and the data is ordinal, as there is a progression from 30 minutes to over 60 minutes. However as these choices were items on a survey NumPy Random's 'choice' function would be suitable as a model. There was a total of 355 responses to this section of the survey so this was taken as the total when calculating the probability weightings for each of the duration bands. A 'Duration' array was created containing the three duration bands, 0 to 30 minutes, 30- 60 minutes and over 60 minutes. There were 137 responses in the first band so this was weighted as 137/355, 121 for the second band giving a probability of 121/355 and 97 responses for the Over 60 minutes response giving a weighting of 97/355.  The model of the Duration variable can be found below.\n"

    "### Time\n",
    "Add the time data. In Cassidy's study the time commuting does not refer to the duration of the commute but to the overall time participants spent as a commuter traveling this duration. There was 343 respondents to this question on the survey with 73 responses indicating a commuting time of 1-29 months, 99 commuting for between 30 and 60 months, 80 commuting between 60 and 131 months and 132 participants commuting for over 132 months (Cassidy, 1992).  This was simulated with np.random.choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why?\n",
    "NumPy Random's choice was used to simulate the time spent commuting. There are four bands in this category. Again the data is ordinal, as there is a progression from 1 month to over 132 months.However as these choices were items on a survey NumPy Random's 'choice' function would be suitable as a model. There was a total of 343 responses to this section of the survey so this was taken as the total when calculating the probability weightings for each of the time bands. A 'Time' array was created containing the four time bands, 1 - 29 months, 30-60 months, 60-131 months and over 132 months. There were 73 responses in the first band so this was weighted as 73/343, 99 for the second band giving a probability of 99/343; 80 responses for the third band giving a weighting of 80/343 and finally 91 responses in the Over 132 month band giving a weighting of 91/343.   The model of the Time variable can be found below."

    "Add the impedance data. In Cassidy's study the impedance (or speed traveled on the commute) was divided into three bands. All participants responded to this question on the survey. The majority of them (207) reported speeds of 17 mph or less as a hindering factor; 97 respondents reported speeds between 13.3 and 30 mph and 66 reported speeds over 30 mph. Again this is simulated with np.random.choice\n",

    "#### Why?\n",
    "NumPy Random's choice was used to simulate the time spent commuting. There are three bands in this category, 17 mph or less, 17.3 - 30 mph and Over 30 mph. Again the data is ordinal, as there is a progression from 17 mph to over 30 mph. However as these choices were items on a survey NumPy Random's 'choice' function would be suitable as a model. There was a total of 370 responses to this section of the survey so this was taken as the total when calculating the probability weightings for each of the time bands (which in this case was the number of people surveyed). An 'Impedance' array was created containing the three impedance bands. There were 207 responses in the first band so this was weighted as 207/370, 97 for the second band giving a probability of 97/370; 66 responses for the third band giving a weighting of 66/370. The model of the Impedance variable can be found below."

    "The method of transportation data could be car or public transport. This is simulated with np.random.choice. Cassidy asked participants their means of commuting.

    "NumPy Random's choice was used to simulate the mode of transportation. There are two bands in this category, car or public transport. Like gender the data is nominal However as these choices were items on a survey NumPy Random's 'choice' function would be suitable as a model. There was a total of 313 responses to this section of the survey so this was taken as the total when calculating the probability weightings for each of the transport bands. A 'Transport' array was created containing the two transport bands, car and public transport. There were 124 responses in the first band so this was weighted as 124/313 and 189 responses for the public transport band giving a probability of 189/313. The model of the Transport variable can be found below."

    "This shows that most participants used public transportation. It would be interesting to see if traveling by bus or train increased or decreased stress. Car transport provides a greater perception of situational control. However, it is debatable which mode provides greater stress. Being in control of the driving in stressful traffic may be more stress inducing than sleeping on bus or train. I would not expect a clear linear relationship between transportation mode and stress. It would also be useful to introduce more categories into the transport list such as bicycle, car, bus and train.  "

    "### Stress\n",
    "Cassidy, (1992) measured stress over five domains, home, commute, work, leisure and personal. There was no numerical data given on these measures but three bar charts illustrated the report graphs with data from these domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cassidy's Stress assesment variables\n",
    "Cassidy 1992 measured stress along five domains namely \n",
    "* **Home domain** - This contained measures of perceived stress including perceived financial stress, social support, time spend at home and if home time was used to mediate work related problems\n",
    "* **Commuting domain** - This contained measures of perceived commuting related stress and commuting mood. \n",
    "* **Work domain** - This contained measures of perceived work related stress including the level of participants commitment to their job. Work stress measures were also collected. \n",
    "* **Leisure domain** - This contained information on the participants leisure attitude and experiences. It measured how often participants exercised and socialised and their perception of their fitness levels. \n",
    "* **Personal domain** - This measured the participants cognitive style such as their problem solving ability and whether or not the attributed events to internal or external factors. It measured participants reported levels of hopelessness, level of control, motivation, confidence and their general perceived stress. It also assessed their level of satisfaction with the direction their life was taking. \n",
    "\n",
    "The report contained four histogram comparison charts, one for the distance of commute, one for the duration of commute and one for the impedance of commute and one for the time spent commuting. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Distance\n",
    "Cassidy found that commuters who travel longer distances reported more negative commuting experiences but did not report more stress than participants traveling shorter distances. However longer distance commuters reported higher scores on motivation and job commitment measures and more positive problem solving ability and use of leisure. Cassidy noted that this suggests longer distance commuters developed coping strategies within other domains to negate the negative effects of a long commute. Commuters who traveled by car had a greater sense of control over their situation however public transport commuters were able to use their commuting time productively along one or more domain. They read, slept,caught up with work etc. Cassidy noted that while this may seem beneficial it may  have long term implications in blurring boundaries between the various domains. In Cassidy's study longer distance commuters scored lower than other participants on the intention to continue to commute at this distance. Cassidy suggested that this shows participants are aware of the negative impact long commutes are having on their other domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Duration\n",
    "Participants reported more negative and less positive responses as the duration of commute increased. There was significantly more work related stress reported for participants with higher duration of commute.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Impedance\n",
    "This measure was the strongest indicator of stress. The greater the impedance i.e. the slower the speed reported significantly more negative and less positive experiences over most of the domains. Cassidy was cautious in drawing conclusions however he suggested there may be an element of 'learned helplessness' when participants cannot control the speed it takes them to and from work. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Time\n",
    "Cassidy found participants who were commuting for several years had more positive perceptions of their commute. This may be due to those who dislike commuting leaving the commuting pool resulting in a hardier long timer commuter population. There was some support for this in the problem solving styles of the longer commuter and their levels of optimism. However long time commuters also showed higher work commitment but lower achievement motivation. Cassidy suggested this showed their commitment to their job which also had negative impact on their home and leisure domain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "Cassidy also investigated mode of transportation. He found that participant car users had more positive experiences than train users. Car users perceived themselves as having more control, spending more time at home and less time commuting than measures warranted. Schaeffer et al as cited in Cassidy, 1992 found that having control was positively associated with lower physiological measures such as lower blood pressure, stress and hostility levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stress score on PSS\n",
    "Firstly the score on the PSS was simulated as an indicator of general stress levels. This was simulated with np.random.choice. First, a template for the 10 questions was created and answers for each question were simulated via the choice function. "

    "#### Simplification of the Stress variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The measure of stress in Cassidy's report was calculated along five domains. Neither the questions on the survey nor the method of scoring was obvious in the report. Hence this project makes some assumptions and simplifications. A general stress indicator is used via the PSS. I was unsure how to link the variables, (distance, duration, time, impedance and transport) to the stress score. I settled on adding weightings based on research indicating if the variable extremes helped or hindered stress levels. There is problems with this as I have no evidence that such a scale passes reliability or validity in what it purports to measure. However the assignment was to simulate the data and not to develop the formula underlying the data (if such a formula even exists). With this in mind the challenge was to add values to the PSS score based on responses to the survey questions. The PSS responses to the 10 questions were numbers from 0 to 4 so the minimum possible value was 0 and the maximum possible value was 40. The adjustments to this scale were as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments\n",
    "Adjustments will then be added on to the PSS depending on participants responses to the other variables on the survey. \n",
    "##### Distance\n",
    "Evidence suggests that longer commute distances is related to higher stress levels in commuters (Chatterjee et al. 2017). There were four bands in the Distance variable so these were rated 1 for 0-5 miles band, 2 for 6-15 miles band, 3 for the 16-30 miles and 4 for over 30 miles band. \n",

    "By the same reasoning that distance is positively correlated to stress levels (increased stress levels with increasing distance of commute), duration,  being a function of distance (speed of commute = distance of commute divided by duration of commute) is also linked to stress levels. The greater the duration of the commute i.e. the daily time taken to commute the more stress is experienced by the commuter(Chatterjee et al. 2017). There were three Duration of commute bands, 0-30 minutes was scored as a 1, 30-60 minutes was scored as 2 and over 60 minutes was scored as 3. \n"

    "##### Impedance\n",
    "Similar to distance and duration, impedance is correlated to stress levels as it is linked to the speed taken to make the commute. Hence slower speeds increases stress levels. As this was the greatest indicator in Cassidy's report higher weightings were given to this. There were three impedance bands, Over 30 mph was rated as 2, 17.3-30 mph was rated as 4 and 17 mph or less was rated as 6. "

    "Schneider as cited in Schaefer 2005 noted that long time commuters of long distances reported negative impact in many areas of their life. Ideally this variable should also be linked to increasing distances however for simplicity it is treated independently. There were four bands in this variable, a rating of 1 was given to the shortest band 1-29 months; a rating of 2 was given to the 30-60 months band; A rating of 3 was given to the 60-131 months band and a rating of 4 was given to the over 132 months band.

    "There is conflicting evidence about the method of commuting and stress levels. Cassidy reported that car users have more positive and less negative commuting experience than those traveling by train (Costa et al as cited in Cassidy, 1992; Gulian et al as cited in Cassidy 1992). However there may be other factors going one such as locus of perceived control and agency. Schaeffer as cited in Cassidy 1992 found control  was positively linked to reduced stress levels and stress measures such as blood pressure. However Wener and Evans, (2011) found car commuters had significantly more perceived stress and low mood than other modes of transport. This may be due to changes in the number of commuters from 1992 to 2011. It was not clear which direction to rank the transport bands of car and public transport hence this variable was not added to the stress score. "
